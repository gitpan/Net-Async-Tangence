NAME
    "Net::Async::Tangence" - use "Tangence" with "IO::Async"

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides concrete implementations of the Tangence base
    classes, allowing either servers or clients to be written based on
    IO::Async.

    To implement a server, see Net::Async::Tangence::Server.

    To implement a client, see Net::Async::Tangence::Client.

    This module itself does not provide any code, and exists only to provide
    the module $VERSION and top-level documentation.
